# Programs_on_Sorting
This repository contains programs based on the concept of sorting. Different types of Sorting Methods are used in these types of programs.

# **What is Sorting?**
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

# **Complexity of Sorting Algorithms**
The efficiency of any sorting algorithm is determined by the time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm.

1. **Time Complexity:** Time complexity refers to the time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution with respect to the size of the input.<br>
It can be represented in different forms:<br>
a). Big-O notation (O)<br>
b). Omega notation (Ω)<br>
c). Theta notation (Θ)<br>

2. **Space Complexity:** Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory used by the algorithm for a complete execution. It includes both the auxiliary memory and the input. The auxiliary memory is the additional space occupied by the algorithm apart from the input data. Usually, auxiliary memory is considered for calculating the space complexity of an algorithm.
